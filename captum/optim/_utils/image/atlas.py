    """
    This function draws a 2D grid across the irregular grid of points, and then groups
    point indices based on the grid cell they fall within. The grid cells are then
    filled with 1D tensors that have anywhere from 0 to n_indices values in them. The
    sets of grid indices can then be used with the compute_avg_cell_samples function
    to create atlas grid cell direction vectors.

    Indices are stored for grid cells in an xy matrix, where the outer lists represent
    x positions and the inner lists represent y positions. Each grid cell is filled
    with 1D tensors that have anywhere from 0 to n_indices index values inside them.

    Below is an example of the index list format for a grid_size of (3, 3):
    indices = [x1[y1, y2, y3], x2[y1, y2, y3], x3[y1, y2, y3]]

    Grid cells would then be ordered like this:
    indices = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]

    Each cell in the above example would contain a list of indices inside a tensor for
    that particular cell, like this:
    indices = [
        [tensor([0, 5]), tensor([1]), tensor([2, 3])],
        [tensor([]), tensor([4]), tensor([])],
