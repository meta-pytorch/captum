        Since some embedding vectors, e.g. word are created and assigned in
        the embedding layers of Pytorch models we need a way to access
        those layers, generate the embeddings and subtract the baseline.
        To do so, we separate embedding layers from the model, compute the embeddings
        separately and do all operations needed outside of the model.
        The original embedding layer is being replaced by
        `InterpretableEmbeddingBase` layer which passes already
        precomputed embedding vectors to the layers below.
