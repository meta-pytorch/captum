class LayerLRP(LRP, LayerAttribution):
    r"""
    Layer-wise relevance propagation is based on a backward propagation
    mechanism applied sequentially to all layers of the model. Here, the
    model output score represents the initial relevance which is decomposed
    into values for each neuron of the underlying layers. The decomposition
    is defined by rules that are chosen for each layer, involving its weights
    and activations. Details on the model can be found in the original paper
    [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130140]. The implementation is
    inspired by the tutorial of the same group
    [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2017.10.011] and the publication by
    Ancona et al. [https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy21R9JAW].

        Args:
            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which relevance is
                        propagated.
                        If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                    - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                        integer, which is applied to all input examples

                    - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                        the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                        is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                    For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                    - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                        elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                    - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                        examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                        #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                        target for the corresponding example.

                    Default: None
            additional_forward_args (tuple, optional): If the forward function
                    requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                    which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                    can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                    argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                    containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                    or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                    forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                    Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                    to these arguments.
                    Default: None

            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                    convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                    is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                    a tuple following attributions.
                    Default: False

            verbose (bool, optional): Indicates whether information on application
                    of rules is printed during propagation.

        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* of **attributions** or 2-element tuple of
                **attributions**, **delta**::
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        The propagated relevance values with respect to each
                        input feature. Attributions will always
                        be the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned. The sum of attributions
                        is one and not corresponding to the prediction score as in other
                        implementations. If attributions for all layers are returned
                        (layer=None) a list of tensors is returned with entries for
                        each layer.
            - **delta** (*tensor* or list of *tensors* returned if
                return_convergence_delta=True):
                        Delta is calculated per example, meaning that the number of
                        elements in returned delta tensor is equal to the number of
                        of examples in input.
                        If attributions for all layers are returned (layer=None) a list
                        of tensors is returned with entries for each layer.
        Examples::

                >>> # ImageClassifier takes a single input tensor of images Nx3x32x32,
                >>> # and returns an Nx10 tensor of class probabilities. It has one

                >>> net = ImageClassifier()
                >>> lrp = LRP(net, net.conv1)
                >>> input = torch.randn(3, 3, 32, 32)
                >>> # Attribution size matches input size: 3x3x32x32
