def infidelity_perturb_func_decorator(pertub_func):
    r"""
    An auxiliary, decorator function that helps with computing
    perturbations given perturbed inputs. It can be useful for cases
    when `pertub_func` returns only perturbed inputs and we
    internally compute the perturbations as
    (input - perturbed_input) / (input - baseline).

    If users decorate their `pertub_func` with
    `@infidelity_perturb_func_decorator` function then their `pertub_func`
    needs to only return perturbed inputs.

    Note that if your attribution algorithm is inherently local such as
    Saliency maps you should not use the decorator because the decorator
    always divides by (input - baseline) and that is unnecessary for local
    methods.
    Args:

        pertub_func(callable): Input perturbation function that takes inputs
            and optionally baselines and returns perturbed inputs

    Returns:

        default_perturb_func(callable): Internal default perturbation
        function that computes the perturbations internally and returns
        perturbations and perturbed inputs.

    Explanation infidelity represents the expected mean-squared error
    between the explanation multiplied by a meaningful input perturbation
    and the differences between the predictor function at its input
    and perturbed input.
    More details about the measure can be found in the following paper:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09392.pdf

    It is derived from the completeness property of well-known attribution
    algorithms and is a computationally more efficient and generalized
    notion of Sensitivy-n. The latter measures correlations between the sum
    of the attributions and the differences of the predictor function at
    its input and fixed baseline. More details about the Sensitivity-n can
    be found here:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06104.pdfs

    The users can perturb the inputs any desired way by providing any
    perturbation function that takes the inputs (and optionally baselines)
    and returns perturbed inputs or perturbed inputs and corresponding
    perturbations.

    This specific implementation is primarily tested for attribution-based
    explanation methods but the idea can be expanded to use for non
    attribution-based interpretability methods as well.

    Args:

        forward_func (callable):
                The forward function of the model or any modification of it.

        perturb_func (callable):
                The perturbation function of model inputs. This function takes
                model inputs and optionally baselines as input arguments and returns
                either a tuple of perturbations and perturbed inputs or just
                perturbed inputs. For example:

                 def my_perturb_func(inputs):
                    <MY-LOGIC-HERE>
                    return perturbations, perturbed_inputs

                If we want to only return perturbed inputs and compute
                perturbations internally then we can wrap perturb_func with
                `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator` decorator such as:

                from captum.metrics import infidelity_perturb_func_decorator
                @infidelity_perturb_func_decorator
                def my_perturb_func(inputs):
                    <MY-LOGIC-HERE>
                    return perturbed_inputs

                In this case we compute perturbations by dividing
                (input - perturbed_input) by (input - baselines) and the user needs to
                only return perturbed inputs in `perturb_func` as described above.

                `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator` makes sense to use only for global
                attribution algorithms such as integrated gradients, deeplift, etc.
                In case user has a local attribution algorithm or decides to compute
                perturbations and perturbed inputs in `perturb_func` then they must not
                use `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator`.

                If there are more than one inputs passed to infidelity function those
                will be passed to `perturb_func` as tuples in the same order as they
                are passed to infidelity function.

                If inputs
                 - is a single tensor, the function needs to return a tuple
                    of perturbations and perturbed input such as:
                      perturb, perturbed_input

                      and only perturbed_input in case
                      `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator`
                      is used.
                 - is a tuple of tensors,
                    corresponding perturbations and perturbed inputs must be computed
                    and returned as tuples in the following format:
                        (perturb1, perturb2, ... perturbN), (perturbed_input1,
                         perturbed_input2, ... perturbed_inputN)
                    Similar to previous case here as well we need to return only
                    perturbed inputs in case `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator`
                    decorates out perturb_func
                It is important to note that for performance reasons `perturb_func`
                isn't called for each example individually but on a batch of
                input examples that are repeated `max_examples_per_batch / batch_size`
                times within the batch.

        inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which
                attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                to the number of examples (aka batch size), and if
                multiple input tensors are provided, the examples must
                be aligned appropriately.

        baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                Baselines define reference values which sometimes represent ablated
                values and are used to compare with the actual inputs to compute
                importance scores in attribution algorithms. They can be represented
                as:
                    - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                      exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                      dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                      with inputs.

                    - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                      be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                    - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                      to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                    - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                      corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                      or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                      dimensions match with the corresponding
                      input tensor.

                    - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                      inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                      for corresponding input tensor.

                Default: None

        attributions (tensor or tuple of tensors):
                Attribution scores computed based on an attribution algorithm.
                This attributions can be computed using the implementations
                in the `captum.attr` package however some of those attributions
                are so called global attributions as described in:
                https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06104.pdf
                In order to estimate the infidelity of the local attributions
                using real-valued perturbations as described in the:
                https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09392.pdf
                we will need to divide those attributions by inputs
                or (inputs - baselines) depending on the type of the algorithm
                that we use. Later, we'll add an option to
                compute both local and global attributions without a need to
                perform that division after retrieving the attributions.
                Also, note that not all attribution algorithms exposed in
                captum are global.
                Examples of local attribution methods are Saliency,
                Guided GradCam, Guided Backprop and Deconvolution.

                If we want to compute the infidelity of global attributions we
                can use a binary perturbation matrix that will allow us to select
                a subset of features from `inputs` or `inputs - baselines` space.
                This will allow us to approximate sensitivity-n for a global
                attribution algorithm.

                Attributions have the same shape and dimensionality as the inputs.
                If inputs is a single tensor then the attributions is a single
                tensor as well. If inputs is provided as a tuple of tensors
                then attributions will be tuples of tensors as well.

                For more details on when to use `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator`,
                please, read the documentation about `perturb_func`

        additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                Note that the perturbations are not computed with respect
                to these arguments. This means that these arguments aren't
                being passed to `perturb_func` as an input argument.

                Default: None
        target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional): Indices for selecting
                predictions from output(for classification cases,
                this is usually the target class).
                If the network returns a scalar value per example, no target
                index is necessary.
                For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                - A single integer or a tensor containing a single
                  integer, which is applied to all input examples

                - A list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                  the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                  is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                  For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                  elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                  examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                  #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                  target for the corresponding example.

                Default: None
        n_samples (int, optional): The number of times input tensors are perturbed.
                Each input example in the inputs tensor is expanded `n_samples`
                times before calling `perturb_func` function.

                Default: 10
        max_examples_per_batch (int, optional): The number of maximum input
                examples that are processed together. In case the number of
                examples (`input batch size * n_samples`) exceeds
                `max_examples_per_batch`, they will be sliced
                into batches of `max_examples_per_batch` examples and processed
                in a sequential order. If `max_examples_per_batch` is None, all
                examples are processed together.

                Default: None
    Returns:

        infidelities (tensor): A tensor of scalar infidelity scores per
                        input example. The first dimension is equal to the
                        number of examples in the input batch and the second
                        dimension is one.

        >>> # ImageClassifier takes a single input tensor of images Nx3x32x32,
        >>> # and returns an Nx10 tensor of class probabilities.
        >>> net = ImageClassifier()
        >>> saliency = Saliency(net)
